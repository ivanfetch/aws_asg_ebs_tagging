# AWS Auto Scaling Group EBS Tagging - User Data
The [user_data.sh](user_data.sh) shell script uses [the AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL#cURL), and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to copy tags from an EC2 instance to all attached EBS volumes. This solution is for customers who can not yet use Lambda, due to [compliance requirements](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/). The included [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io) code will create an IAM policy, role, and instance profile which the user data script requires, and a launch configuration and auto scaling group to demonstrate the script.
