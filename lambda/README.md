# AWS Auto Scaling Group EBS Tagging - Lambda Function
The [Lambda function](lambda-code/example-asg-lambda-tagger.py) copies all tags from a new auto scaled EC2 instance, to the EBS volumes which are attached to the instance. A [CloudWatch event rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Create-CloudWatch-Events-Rule.html) should be configured to run a Lambda function when a [EC2 Instance Launch Successful CloudWatch event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/cloud-watch-events.html#launch-successful) is received. The included [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io) code will create an IAM role for use by this Lambda function, deploy the Lambda code, and create the CloudWatch event, rule, target, and permissions.
